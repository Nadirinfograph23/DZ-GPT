# DZ Agent — ChatGPT Continuation Notes

## Current objective
Make DZ Agent understand and speak natural Algerian Darija, including Arabic-script Darija, Franco-Arabic, mixed French/English technical speech, spelling variants, and regional vocabulary.

## Production source of truth
- Repository: `Nadirinfograph23/DZ-GPT`.
- Production source branch: `devin/1774405518-init-dz-gpt` (treat as effective production/main for project work).
- Live site: `https://dzagent.app/`.
- Primary deployment: GitHub Actions `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare-worker.yml` → `npm install` → YouTube intent patch → `npm run build` → `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v4` → `wrangler deploy --config wrangler.toml` → `/api/version` + `/version.json` verification → production feature smoke tests.
- Do not use Vercel as the production path. A Vercel status on recent commits reports `Account is blocked`; Cloudflare Worker is the intended production runtime.
- Secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`; never store or print their values.
- A commit is not considered deployed until the exact SHA is observed from the live version endpoint and the relevant production smoke test passes.

## YouTube root-cause investigation — 2026-09-24
- The visible message `🔍 لم أجد نتائج ... على YouTube` means the request reached the YouTube response path but `youtubeResults` ended empty; the update banner only proves that version metadata changed.
- `wrangler.toml` aliases `youtube-sr` to `workers/stubs/youtube-sr.js`, so the Worker does not use the normal Node `youtube-sr` implementation.
- The Worker stub now has direct YouTube HTML search first, then multiple Invidious instances, Jina Reader, and Google site-search, with hard timeouts, an overall deadline, YouTube ID validation, and result normalization.
- The production Worker intent detector historically contained `شرح .*فيديو|tutorial|how to`; this does NOT match a normal request such as `شرح أدوات الفوتوشوب`.
- The workflow had a build-time patch for that regex, but it was previously fail-open: if the source changed, the script could silently skip the patch. This was a major reliability weakness because the deployment could proceed with the old intent detector.
- The latest source of truth is the actual branch content, not historical commit notes: the branch was found at `f39db30ec68754a32f0eb605a7db2f1753783d45` before the latest repair, and the Worker source still contained the old intent detector. This explains why earlier claimed hardening was not visible on the live path.
- The accidental placeholder write to `workers/entry.js` was immediately reverted by moving the branch ref back to `f39db30ec68754a32f0eb605a7db2f1753783d45`; no application source was left corrupted by that mistake.
- The intent patch was then hardened to validate the exact regression queries before Wrangler deployment: `شرح أدوات الفوتوشوب`, `شرح فوتوشوب للمبتدئين`, `دروس الفوتوشوب`, and `Photoshop tutorial`.
- Latest intent-test commits: `a05d4a2bd93125b3fa8b1d0ddd86aa14e46566bb` followed by `ce22d690b7d9ec9f7a9e216e0e6320bac89918d3`, with the latter correcting JavaScript RegExp escaping in the regression test.

## Latest hardening commits
- `ae01670e7a4fd64148ade5ec699234ee78e1f178` — `fix: fail closed when YouTube intent patch is missing`.
- `ab9afe7feaba88b08f93e9db40594d1b43b71c7f` — `ci: fail deployment when YouTube intent is not actually patched`.
- `a05d4a2bd93125b3fa8b1d0ddd86aa14e46566bb` — added exact regression-query validation.
- `ce22d690b7d9ec9f7a9e216e0e6320bac89918d3` — corrected the regression-test escaping.
- The current production branch HEAD is `ce22d690b7d9ec9f7a9e216e0e6320bac89918d3`.
- A previous Cloudflare run `35896761561` was cancelled, so it cannot be treated as proof of deployment. The current HEAD has not yet been verified by a completed Cloudflare run in the available GitHub workflow-run query.

## YouTube selected-video flow
- Existing frontend supports multiple YouTube result cards, thumbnails, selected-video preview, and `تحليل و مناقشة الفيديو`.
- Selected-video context must remain tied to the selected video through `youtubeContext` and `handleVideoDiscussion`; never turn a selected-video follow-up into a fresh keyword search.
- Thumbnail strategy: stable `https://i.ytimg.com/vi/<ID>/hqdefault.jpg` fallback rather than expiring signed thumbnail URLs.
- Preview strategy: standard YouTube embed with the current site origin and `playsinline`.

## Update banner / version chain
- The previous 15-second update banner with `🚀 تحديث الآن` remains part of `src/utils/versionChecker.ts`.
- Production version chain: Cloudflare deployment → generated `public/version.json` → Worker `GET /api/version` → `versionChecker`/Service Worker → update countdown.
- `/api/version` is Cloudflare-native and uses `no-store` headers; it reads the deployed `version.json` through the `ASSETS` binding.
- The banner alone is never proof that the YouTube backend is healthy.

## Verification checklist for every future YouTube fix
1. Read this file first.
2. Work only from `devin/1774405518-init-dz-gpt` unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
3. Inspect current branch SHA and preserve newer changes.
4. Verify the Worker YouTube intent source before modifying provider code.
5. Verify `wrangler.toml` still aliases `youtube-sr` to the intended Worker adapter.
6. Run/build the exact query `شرح أدوات الفوتوشوب` through production smoke test.
7. Require non-empty `youtubeResults`, valid IDs, titles, thumbnails.
8. Verify `/api/version` and `/version.json` expose the exact deployed SHA.
9. Test the browser flow: search → cards → thumbnails → select → preview → `تحليل و مناقشة الفيديو` → follow-up.
10. Record commit SHA, CI result, Cloudflare deployment result, and live verification here.

## Security / credentials
- Never request or store Cloudflare Global API Keys, API tokens, GitHub tokens, or other secrets in repository files or chat notes.
- Existing GitHub Actions secrets are sufficient for Cloudflare deployment.

## Critical live-debug finding — 2026-09-27
- The live failure persists because the update banner and the YouTube feature are separate verification domains: the banner can detect a new version while the YouTube Worker route remains old or the deployment can be cancelled before Cloudflare serves the new Worker.
- The branch was explicitly verified at `f39db30ec68754a32f0eb605a7db2f1753783d45` and the actual `workers/entry.js` still contained the old YouTube intent regex. This is stronger evidence than earlier notes claiming later hardening commits were on the branch.
- Current branch HEAD is now `ce22d690b7d9ec9f7a9e216e0e6320bac89918d3`. The latest change is in the exact build-time intent patch and includes source-level regression tests for the user's failing query.
- GitHub status still reports an unrelated Vercel failure (`Account is blocked`); this must not be used as Cloudflare deployment proof.
- Cloudflare deployment proof is still pending: a completed successful Cloudflare Actions run must serve the exact HEAD through `/api/version`, followed by the production YouTube smoke test. Until that happens, do not report the live YouTube fix as complete.

## Doctor search restoration — 2026-09-27
- The current branch checkout was verified at 37b5b65 before this repair; older SHA notes above are historical and must not be treated as the current branch state.
- The Node/Express YouTube and doctor engines both work locally: the Photoshop-tools query returned 8 valid YouTube results, and the dentist-in-Annaba query returned 7 doctor records with profile/source URLs.
- Root cause found in the Cloudflare path: workers/entry.js returned doctor search as Markdown plus doctorSearch: true, but omitted the structured richType doctor-results, doctors, dirs, and metadata consumed by DZChatBox. Production therefore could not render the interactive doctor table even when the search succeeded.
- Repair: the Worker doctor response now includes the same structured doctor payload as the Express path (richType, real doctors, directory links, specialty/city metadata, cache/GPS flags, and the existing dua). Existing Markdown remains as a fallback.
- Verification completed before the workspace restart: node tests/basic.test.js → 32/32 passed; direct YouTube controller search → 8 results with valid IDs/titles/thumbnails; direct doctor search → 7 results; Express routes → YouTube 8 results and doctor 7 results using a browser User-Agent. node --check workers/entry.js also passed before the restart.
- The full npm run build could not be completed in the local environment: the TypeScript process was killed with exit code 137 (resource exhaustion), with no TypeScript diagnostic emitted. This is an environment verification failure, not evidence of a source compile error.
- Pending after commit: run the Cloudflare workflow, confirm the deployed SHA via /api/version and /version.json, then run the production YouTube and doctor smoke tests. Do not call the live repair complete before those checks pass.

## Deployment follow-up — 2026-09-28
- Repair commit: ce06fc1208dea47ee3cbc143bf63a4e21f9de718 (ce06fc1), pushed to devin/1774405518-init-dz-gpt. It changes only workers/entry.js and this documentation file.
- Cloudflare workflow run 36370737180 was triggered for that exact SHA but completed with failure in Build application assets; Deploy Worker and all live smoke tests were skipped. The run URL is https://github.com/Nadirinfograph23/DZ-GPT/actions/runs/36370737180.
- Local npm run build was also killed with exit code 137 during TypeScript compilation in the restarted verification environment. No TypeScript diagnostic was emitted, so the source build remains unproven rather than proven broken.
- Live version check at 2026-09-28 02:43 UTC still served version.json commit 36c35fa1223431de09b3d1ee07f9aeb0b02157d2 from 2026-08-14; /api/version reported commit unknown. This confirms the doctor repair is not deployed to production yet.
- Next action: diagnose the Build application assets failure, get a successful Cloudflare deployment for ce06fc1 (or a follow-up fix), then require /api/version, /version.json, and production doctor/YouTube smoke tests before marking the repair complete.


## Doctor table UI update — 2026-09-28
- User selected option #2 (shadcn-data-table style) for the doctor-results interface and requested support for long result lists.
- Kept the existing DoctorResultsPanel data model and phone/Google Maps/source actions intact.
- Added client-side pagination to `src/components/DoctorResultsPanel.tsx`: 20 results per page by default, selectable 20/50/100, previous/next controls, and a visible range/total counter.
- Added responsive pagination styling to `src/styles/doctor-results.css`; the existing horizontal mobile table behavior remains intact.
- Commits: `63fc7be2b550898a40937d000cb43956ef74f023` (component pagination), `b42162296aeba36e6795179d8747eeb9371b045f` (pagination styling).
- This is a UI-only improvement; the doctor search backend and structured `doctor-results` payload are preserved.
- Deployment is still pending until the Cloudflare build succeeds and the exact deployed SHA is verified through `/api/version` and live doctor smoke tests.


## Doctor table rendering fix — 2026-09-28
- User reported that a query such as `طبيب أسنان في عنابة` was returning only the query/date text instead of the doctor table.
- Root cause found in `src/components/DZChatBox.tsx`: the Vercel AI SDK streaming fast-path could consume the request and return plain text before the full `/api/dz-agent-chat` response with `richType: 'doctor-results'` reached the existing `DoctorResultsPanel` renderer.
- Fix: structured doctor searches now bypass the generic streaming fast-path and continue through the full response path, where `doctor-results` is converted into `DoctorResultsPanel` with doctors, sources, phone links, Google Maps links, and pagination.
- Fix commit: `cda3d48e41af0519c3bb25487389f6518fbdb9d7` on `devin/1774405518-init-dz-gpt`.
- Deployment is still subject to the established Cloudflare production workflow and must be verified by the exact deployed SHA plus a live doctor search smoke test.


## 2026-09-28 — فرض نشر آخر تحديثات الفرع + الجداول للقوائم
- الفرع الإنتاجي المعتمد: `devin/1774405518-init-dz-gpt`.
- تم الحفاظ على جميع التحديثات الأخيرة وعدم الرجوع إلى commit `36c35fa1223431de09b3d1ee07f9aeb0b02157d2`؛ هذا الـcommit مرجع لمسار النشر الناجح فقط.
- آخر إصلاح بحث الأطباء: `35f51ca9b88aaadb514d77a4e10d6c449347ecef`، لإرجاع نتائج Docteur360 كبيانات منظمة (اسم، تخصص، هاتف، عنوان، رابط الملف).
- قاعدة واجهة النتائج: عند وجود قائمة منظمة (أطباء، أخبار، نتائج بحث، خدمات، عناصر متعددة...) يجب عرضها في جدول منظم ومتجاوب على الهاتف بدلاً من نص/روابط مصادر فقط. عند عدم توفر بيانات حقيقية فقط يُستخدم fallback.
- يجب أن تبقى بيانات الجدول مرتبطة بالـrich payload الموجود في الواجهة، وألا يتم تمريرها إلى مسار streaming النصي العام الذي يحوّلها إلى نص فقط.
- يجب أن يمر النشر من آخر HEAD للفرع، مع التحقق من SHA المنشور بعد البناء؛ لا يجوز نشر commit قديم مكان آخر التحديثات.
